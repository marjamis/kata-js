# Light Example

## Plan

A light globe simulation with a colour that can be dynamically selected with RGB values on slider inputs. This example has:

* A shape made from CSS elements to represent the light globe
* CSS variables for dynamically selecting the globes colour and a strobing effect
* A rudimentary light/dark mode
